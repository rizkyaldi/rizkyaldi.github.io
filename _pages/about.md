Hello! I am a game developer that specialize in Unreal Engine with 2 years of experience.

I am a core member of an ongoing game development project, where I have made significant contributions. While I havenâ€™t worked on many different projects, I dedicate most of my time and effort to this one. In this portfolio, I'll share the features I have implemented for the project.

## Radial UI

The first thing that I've implemented is Radial UI system for the game. It detects predetermined item from the inventory system and making it more easy and dynamic to equip the item from Radial UI.

## Inventory System Refactor

I've refactored the existing inventory system to make it more clean, readable, and scalable. And it's coded with replication in mind. It has a few functions like Equip, Drop, Use (Combine 2 items), and etc. And it also includes right click drop down menu and tool tip for the items.

## Migrated from Unreal Engine 4 into Unreal Engine 5

In the past year, we decided to migrate into Unreal Engine 5 to use the new features that has been added into Unreal Engine 5. And I did the migration into unreal engine 5.2 at first and updating it later into 5.6.

## Integrated Wwise Audio Plugins

Our team decided that we will be using Wwise audio plugin instead of Unreal engine audio and FMOD. And I integrated Wwise plugin and implemented audio using the Wwise plugin.

## Cooking System and related UI

I implemented a complex cooking system that feels like a sandbox cooking system. This cooking system is data-driven using Data Table in unreal engine. It has stat values on the cooking output and it calculated based on the cooking input thus making it complex. And I programmed the whole UI of the cooking system, including a few animation like changing between cooking mode.

## NPC Shop with custom currency

The next thing is the shop, it is implemented with a regenerating and decaying items on the shop. And the price is depending on the stock available on the shop. Implementing it with a custom currency (e.g. 1 gold = 15 silver, 1 silver = 5 bronze). I also did the whole programming on the UI side of the shop.

## Fishing
Implemented fishing that is working similarly like Stardew Valley. The UI also programmed by me.

## Woodcutting

Implemented woodcut with chaos destruction. It's implemented with chaos destruction to make it more immersive.

## Handled 3D Assets pipelines

I handled the 3D asset pipeline, including exporting and importing models from Blender to Unreal Engine.

## Character Animation Blueprint

I did a little bit programming with the character Animation Blueprint, ensuring the locomotion and other gameplay animation (fishing, woodcutting) works properly.

## Snow Deformation/Trails

I developed the material and underlying logic for dynamic snow deformation on the landscape. This system allows players and other selected object.
